## Technical Stack Research

### 1. TypeScript Game State Management

**Decision**: Use a TypeScript class-based approach with state management pattern

**Rationale**:
- Provides type safety for game state
- Enables clear separation of concerns between game logic and UI
- Makes state transitions explicit and testable
- Aligns with requirement FR-010 for separate game state

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux-style state management (over-engineered for this use case)
- Simple object literals (lacks encapsulation)
- Context API (unnecessary for single component app)

### 2. DOM Manipulation Strategy

**Decision**: Direct DOM manipulation using TypeScript with event delegation

**Rationale**:
- Lightweight and performant
- No framework dependencies needed
- Event delegation reduces event listener overhead
- Matches requirement for simple, efficient implementation

**Alternatives considered**:
- Virtual DOM frameworks (unnecessary complexity)
- jQuery (adds unnecessary dependency)
- Web Components (over-engineered for requirements)

### 3. Game Grid Implementation

**Decision**: CSS Grid with semantic HTML

**Rationale**:
- Perfect for 3x3 grid layout
- Built-in responsiveness
- Semantic markup improves accessibility
- Easy animation integration for winning combinations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Flexbox (more complex for grid layout)
- Table layout (less flexible for styling)
- Canvas (unnecessary for simple grid)

### 4. Animation Implementation

**Decision**: CSS Transitions/Animations

**Rationale**:
- Hardware accelerated
- Easy to maintain
- Good browser support
- Lightweight implementation

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript animations (less performant)
- Web Animations API (too complex for needs)
- Animation libraries (unnecessary dependency)

## Best Practices

1. **TypeScript Organization**
   - Use strict mode
   - Implement interfaces for game state
   - Use enums for player and game status
   - Implement proper type guards

2. **HTML Structure**
   - Use semantic elements (main, section, button)
   - Include ARIA attributes for accessibility
   - Proper heading hierarchy

3. **CSS Architecture**
   - BEM naming convention
   - CSS Custom Properties for theming
   - Mobile-first responsive design

4. **Game Logic**
   - Pure functions for win detection
   - Immutable state updates
   - Event-driven architecture

## Performance Considerations

1. **Render Performance**
   - Minimal DOM updates
   - Use CSS transforms for animations
   - Debounce rapid clicks

2. **State Management**
   - Single source of truth
   - Predictable state updates
   - Clear update lifecycle

All technical decisions align with the specified requirements and provide a solid foundation for implementation.
