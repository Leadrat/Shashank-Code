# Implementation Plan: Tic Tac Toe Web Game

**Branch**: `001-tic-tac-toe-game` | **Date**: October 24, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-tic-tac-toe-game/spec.md`

## Summary

Implementation of a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game using TypeScript, focusing on a clean separation of game logic from UI, with responsive design and animations for winning combinations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode  
**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla TypeScript/DOM)  
**Storage**: N/A (in-memory game state)  
**Testing**: Jest with TypeScript support  
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)  
**Project Type**: Web game (single-page application)  
**Performance Goals**: 100ms response to player moves, 60fps animations  
**Constraints**: Mobile-responsive, keyboard accessible, works offline  
**Scale/Scope**: 2-player local game, single session

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

No violations of project constitution. The implementation:
- Uses no external dependencies (clean, minimal approach)
- Maintains clear separation of concerns (game logic / UI)
- Follows type-safe development practices
- Includes comprehensive testing strategy
- Preserves simplicity in architecture

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure with clear separation between game logic and UI components. This structure:
- Keeps game logic isolated in `game/` directory
- Maintains type definitions in `models/`
- Separates concerns between state, board, and rules
- Places tests alongside source code
- Uses minimal root-level files for HTML/CSS

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup (0.5 day)
- Initialize TypeScript project with strict configuration
- Create HTML structure and base CSS
- Set up testing environment
- Implement basic file structure

### Phase 2: Game Logic (1 day)
- Implement game state management
- Create board manipulation functions
- Add win/draw detection
- Build score tracking system
- Write unit tests for game logic

### Phase 3: UI Development (1 day)
- Build responsive game grid
- Implement player interactions
- Add turn indicators and status display
- Create reset functionality
- Style game interface

### Phase 4: Polish & Testing (0.5 day)
- Add winning combination animations
- Implement score display
- Write UI integration tests
- Add keyboard accessibility
- Perform cross-browser testing

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Game state transitions
- Win detection algorithms
- Move validation logic
- Score tracking accuracy

### Integration Tests
- Player interaction flow
- UI state synchronization
- Animation triggers
- Keyboard navigation

### Acceptance Tests
- Full game scenarios
- Edge cases handling
- Mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility compliance

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas
- Simple feature scope
- No external dependencies
- Clear requirements
- Standard web technologies

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive unit testing
- Progressive enhancement
- Mobile-first design
- Keyboard accessibility
